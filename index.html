                <p>When you think of kittens your first thought is probably of how adorable they are. 
Let's face it, they are little fur balls of CUTE! But, think of this page as a
cautionary tale..... as a warning, don't let their meek appearance fool you, these creatures
are really just implementers of destruction! Their long survival is only due to how
fluffy and adorable they are, just think about all the many people you hear that refer to their cats as
assholes, and yet, they will outlive us all. They've captured us all in their spell, as they plot our demise and 
eventually take over the world. In the meantime, they will continue to use us to do their bidding. </p>
                
                <p>You may be thinking to yourself, there's no way any of that could be true, that I'm perhaps being paranoid, 
but take a look at the pictures and see the destruction for yourself. They destroy your things and furniture and 
look smugly on as you clean up behind them, while demanding you serve them dinner. 
I've heard numerous stories and seen evidence of the scratches and bites these fluff balls inflict on their owners. 
A cat bite is nothing to scoff at, although they are small in size, these creatures can do some serious damage, and 
in fact cat's have some of the dirtiest mouths around, if you are to suffer a bite from one, please see a doctor immediately, 
as you'll likely need antibiotics, otherwise, your arm could fall off and rest assured, your cat will eat it! </p>
